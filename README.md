## 🎯 Business Objective

The dashboard was built with the perspective of a data analyst working in a food delivery company. The company wanted to answer the following key business questions:

- **How are we performing overall in terms of delivery times, revenue, and customer experience?**
- **Which cities and product categories are performing best or need attention?**
- **What patterns can we find in customer behavior, ratings, and payment methods?**
- **Where are our operational bottlenecks or opportunities for efficiency improvements?**

The dashboard helps **business heads, operations managers, and customer success teams** make **data-driven decisions**.

## 🧠 What We Did (Analysis Approach)

- Created custom measures and calculated columns using **DAX**.
- Segmented the dashboard into **four focused pages** for clear storytelling.
